In addition, you have to take in consideration the four cores of credibility:

4 CORES OF CREDIBILITY 
1. Integrity.  Integrity is deep honesty and truthfulness. It is who we really are. It includes congruence, humility, and courage.       Congruence:   To live in harmony with your deepest values and beliefs. You walk your talk.    Humility:   To stand firmly for principles, especially in the face of opposition. You are more concerned with what is right than with being right.    Courage:   To act according to principles. You do the right thing – especially when it’s hard to do.  
2. Intent.	Intent is your fundamental motive or agenda and the behavior that follows. Motive: The motive that inspires the greatest rust is genuine caring – about people, your values, the quality of what you do. Agenda: The agenda that inspires the greatest trust is seeking mutual benefit – genuinely wanting what’s best for everyone involved. Behavior: The behavior that best creates credibility is acting in the best interests of everyone. 
3. Capabilities.	Capable people and organization inspire confidence. Capability is our capacity to achieve results and includes our talents, attitudes, skills, knowledge, and style. Talents: What are my unique, native strengths? Attitudes: Do I approach work with energy and the determination to contribute? Skills: Do I continuously upgrade my skills? Knowledge: What am I doing to stay current and keep learning? Style: Does my style of doing things get in the way or ease the path? 
4. Results.	Results matter! They matter enormously to your credibility. People evaluate your results/performance on three key indicators: past performance, current performance, and anticipated performance. Past Performance: Your reputation and track record for delivering results, not just activities. Current Performance: Producing results now, not resting on past performance. Anticipated Performance: How people project you will perform in the future based on past and current results.
